# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a complete analysis and modeling pipeline for the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).  
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger data.

## ðŸ“’ Project Overview

This is a binary classification problem where the target is `Survived` (0 or 1).  
The project includes data inspection, cleaning, feature engineering, and testing multiple classification models to predict survival.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- `Sex` and `Pclass` were strong indicators of survival probability.
- Missing values in `Age` were imputed based on title and passenger class.
- A new feature `Title` was extracted from names, which improved prediction.
- `Cabin` was mostly missing and dropped, but a binary feature `HasCabin` was created.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Logistic Regression â€” Baseline model
- Random Forest Classifier â€” Performed best overall
- Support Vector Machine â€” Tuned with grid search
- K-Nearest Neighbors â€” Used for comparison

## ðŸ§ª Notebook Summary

- Data exploration and missing value analysis
- Feature transformation and encoding
- Model training and evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
- Submission file creation for Kaggle testing

## âœ… Final Notes

This project showcases the full cycle of a classification task with tabular data, including data wrangling, model tuning, and insight extraction.  
Further improvements could include more feature interactions or use of ensemble stacking.
